# ROS-control-panel
The purpose of this control panel is to develop a GUI for users who do not have background in ROS. With this control panel, the users can perform SLAM, map modification, navigation, record a self_defined path and use the defined path for navaigtion without typing ros commands.

In order to use this panel, you are assumed to have the package for SLAM, map modification, navigation. The scripts to define a path and use the path for navigation are included in this repository. 

Customize your own panel:
There are few vairables you can change to customize your application.

gazebo_package: the package where you store the launch file for the SLAM application
gazebo_launch: the launch file that should contain everything needed for SLAM (gazebo world, robot, rviz)
navigation_package: the package where you store the launch file for the navigation application
navigation_launch: the launch file that should contain everything needed for navigation(gazebo world, robot, map used for navigation, navigation algorithm)
move_base_package: the package where you store the launch file for the move base navigation
move_base_lanch: the launch file that should contain everything needed for move_base_navigation (gazebo world, robot, move base navigation algorithm)
rviz_package: the package where you store the rviz launch file
rviz_launch: launch the rviz with the configuration in this file
map_path_pmg: the pmg file where you will save the map generated by SLAM in this path
map_path_yaml: the yaml file where you will save the map generated by SLAM in this path
save_map_path: usually the map generated by SLAM will need some modification before use. This path is where you will save the modified path. 
good_math_path_yaml:  This is the yaml file where you store the modified map in this path.
